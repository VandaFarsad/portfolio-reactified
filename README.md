# Developers Portfolio Page with Django and React

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository of my Portfolio Page! This project is a hybrid web application built using the Django backend framework and the React frontend library. It leverages the power of Django for server-side rendering and React for a dynamic and interactive user interface. TypeScript is used for type-safe JavaScript, and Docker is used for containerization.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for frontend development)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (for backend development)

## Getting Started

**Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VandaFarsad/portfolio-reactified-boilerplate
cd portfolio-reactified-boilerplate
```

**Start the application using Docker:**

```bash
docker compose up
```

The application will be accessible at:

- Backend (Django Admin Page): http://localhost:8000/admin
- Frontend (React App): http://localhost:3000/

For **production**, use the following command:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
```

**Create an environment file for production deployment:**

In order to deploy the application in production, create a `.env` file in the root directory. You can use [.env.local](.env.local) as a reference.

## Nginx in Production

For production, the Nginx service is used to serve the application. The Nginx configuration can be found in the [nginx](./nginx) directory.

Here is the GitHub repository for the Nginx image used in production: [JonasAlfredsson/docker-nginx-certbot](https://github.com/JonasAlfredsson/docker-nginx-certbot)

## Configuration

- Backend configuration files can be found in the `main` directory.
- Frontend configuration files can be found in the `frontend` directory.
- Nginx configuration for production is available in the `nginx` directory.
